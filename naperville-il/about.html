          <h2>Who We Are</h2>
          <p>Naperville EV Charge is a locally owned and operated electrical contracting company specializing exclusively in EV charger installation. We were founded right here in Naperville, IL with a simple mission: make the transition to electric vehicle ownership as easy and affordable as possible for DuPage County residents and businesses.</p>
          <p>Our founders recognized that while EV adoption in the Chicago suburbs was accelerating rapidly — driven by the area's high concentration of Metra commuters looking to pair EV ownership with transit-oriented lifestyles, the growing number of remote workers in communities like the Naperville Riverwalk neighborhoods, and the increasing availability of affordable EVs — many homeowners and businesses were struggling to navigate the installation process. Permit requirements, ComEd rebate applications, electrical panel assessments, and charger selection felt overwhelming. We built Naperville EV Charge to remove every one of those obstacles.</p>
          <p>Today, we've completed over 143 installations across Naperville, Aurora, Bolingbrook, Downers Grove, Lisle, and Wheaton. Our team includes EVSE-certified electricians, Illinois Licensed Electrical Contractors, and customer service specialists who genuinely love electric vehicles and sustainable transportation.</p>

          <h2>Our Certifications &amp; Credentials</h2>
          <p>Every member of our installation team holds the credentials required to perform safe, code-compliant EV charger installations in Illinois:</p>
          <ul class="content-list">
            <li><strong>EVSE Installation Certification</strong> — Specialized training in Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment installation, covering NEC Article 625, load calculations, and charger commissioning.</li>
            <li><strong>Illinois Licensed Electrical Contractor</strong> — We hold an active Illinois Licensed Electrical Contractor credential issued under the Illinois Commerce Commission, required for all permitted electrical work in the state.</li>
            <li><strong>Fully Licensed &amp; Insured</strong> — General liability insurance and workers' compensation coverage protect you and our team on every job site.</li>
            <li><strong>ComEd Familiar Contractor</strong> — We are well-versed in Commonwealth Edison utility requirements and experienced in filing the $200 ComEd EV charger rebate on behalf of our customers.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Our Commitment to Naperville</h2>
          <p>Naperville is consistently ranked among the best places to live in Illinois and the United States, and the community's EV adoption rate reflects its forward-looking values. From the established neighborhoods near the Downtown Naperville Riverwalk and Centennial Beach to the newer developments along the Route 59 corridor and Ogden Avenue, Naperville residents are embracing clean transportation at a remarkable pace.</p>
          <p>We are proud to be part of that transition. Every installation we complete reduces fossil fuel dependence, lowers household transportation costs, and contributes to cleaner air across DuPage County. We take that responsibility seriously, which is why we never cut corners on quality, permitting, or safety.</p>
          <p>When you hire Naperville EV Charge, you're not just getting an electrician — you're getting a team that genuinely cares about making EV ownership work for you, your home, and your community.</p>

          <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
          <p>There are general electricians who will install an EV charger, and then there are specialists who live and breathe EVSE. We are the latter. Because EV charger installation is our core business — not a side service — we stay current on every new charger model, changing utility rebate programs like ComEd's offerings, evolving NEC code updates, and best practices for residential and commercial EVSE systems.</p>
          <p>We also believe in transparent pricing. When we give you a quote, it includes the permit fee, inspection scheduling with City of Naperville Building Services, and rebate application assistance. There are no surprise line items after the job is done.</p>
