          <h2>Who We Are</h2>
          <p>Scottsdale EV Charge is a locally owned and operated electrical contracting company specializing exclusively in EV charger installation. We were founded right here in Scottsdale, AZ with a simple mission: make the transition to electric vehicle ownership as easy and affordable as possible for Scottsdale residents and businesses.</p>
          <p>Our founders recognized that while EV adoption in Scottsdale was accelerating rapidly — driven by the city's affluent and environmentally conscious residents, the popularity of luxury EVs from Tesla, Lucid, and Porsche in communities like DC Ranch, McCormick Ranch, and Gainey Ranch, and the increasing availability of EVs across all price points — many homeowners and businesses were struggling to navigate the installation process. Permit requirements, utility rebate applications, electrical panel assessments, and charger selection felt overwhelming. We built Scottsdale EV Charge to remove every one of those obstacles.</p>
          <p>Today, we've completed over 138 installations across Scottsdale, Phoenix, Tempe, Chandler, Paradise Valley, Mesa, and Fountain Hills. Our team includes EVSE-certified electricians, Arizona ROC-licensed contractors, and customer service specialists who genuinely love electric vehicles and sustainable transportation.</p>

          <h2>Our Certifications &amp; Credentials</h2>
          <p>Every member of our installation team holds the credentials required to perform safe, code-compliant EV charger installations in Arizona:</p>
          <ul class="content-list">
            <li><strong>EVSE Installation Certification</strong> — Specialized training in Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment installation, covering NEC Article 625, load calculations, and charger commissioning.</li>
            <li><strong>Arizona ROC Licensed Electrical Contractor</strong> — We hold an active Arizona Registrar of Contractors (ROC) electrical license, required for all permitted electrical work in the state.</li>
            <li><strong>Fully Licensed &amp; Insured</strong> — General liability insurance and workers' compensation coverage protect you and our team on every job site.</li>
            <li><strong>APS Approved Contractor</strong> — We are familiar with Arizona Public Service utility requirements and are experienced in filing the $250 APS EV charger rebate on behalf of our customers.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Our Commitment to Scottsdale</h2>
          <p>Scottsdale is one of Arizona's most dynamic cities, and its EV adoption rate reflects the community's forward-thinking, sustainability-minded identity. From the gated luxury communities of DC Ranch and Gainey Ranch to the vibrant neighborhoods of Old Town Scottsdale and the master-planned corridors of McCormick Ranch and WestWorld, our community is embracing clean transportation faster than almost anywhere in the state.</p>
          <p>Scottsdale's proximity to the Mayo Clinic campus, the tech and biomedical employers that surround it, Kierland Commons, and Scottsdale Fashion Square brings thousands of high-income professionals into the area each day — and a growing share of them drive electric. We are proud to be the local team powering that transition.</p>
          <p>We take that responsibility seriously, which is why we never cut corners on quality, permitting, or safety. When you hire Scottsdale EV Charge, you're not just getting an electrician — you're getting a team that genuinely cares about making EV ownership work for you, your home, and your community.</p>

          <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
          <p>There are general electricians who will install an EV charger, and then there are specialists who live and breathe EVSE. We are the latter. Because EV charger installation is our core business — not a side service — we stay current on every new charger model, changing utility rebate programs, evolving NEC code updates, and best practices for residential and commercial EVSE systems.</p>
          <p>We also believe in transparent pricing. When we give you a quote, it includes the City of Scottsdale permit fee, inspection scheduling, and rebate application assistance. There are no surprise line items after the job is done.</p>
