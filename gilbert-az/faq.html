              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Residential Level 2 EV charger installation in Gilbert typically costs between $799 and $1,800, all-in. Here is how costs break down:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Charger unit:</strong> $200–$700 depending on brand and smart features</li>
                  <li><strong>Electrical labor:</strong> $300–$600 for the dedicated 240V circuit</li>
                  <li><strong>Panel upgrade (if needed):</strong> $500–$1,500 extra for older 100A panels</li>
                  <li><strong>Permit fee:</strong> $75–$150 (included in our quotes)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After the $250 APS rebate and 30% Federal Tax Credit, many Gilbert homeowners pay $350–$900 net. <a href="services/ev-charger-installation-cost-gilbert.html">See full cost breakdown.</a></p>

              <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">Do you offer free quotes?</button>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Yes, always. We provide free, no-obligation quotes for all residential and commercial EV charger installations. You can request a quote online through our contact form, or call us directly at (480) 555-0101. We typically respond within one business hour during weekday hours.</p>

              <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">Are there any hidden fees in your quotes?</button>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>No. Our quotes are flat-rate and itemized. The price we quote includes the charger unit (if you're purchasing through us), all labor, the permit application fee, inspection scheduling, and APS rebate assistance. The only scenario where cost can increase after a quote is if we discover an unforeseen issue at the site — like wiring that does not meet current code — and we always discuss this with you before proceeding.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">Does APS offer a rebate for EV charger installation in Gilbert?</button>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Yes. Arizona Public Service (APS) currently offers a $250 rebate for residential customers who install a qualifying Level 2 (240V) EV charger. Eligibility requirements include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Must be an active APS residential customer at the installation address</li>
                  <li>The charger must be a Level 2 (240V) EVSE unit</li>
                  <li>Installation must be performed by a licensed electrical contractor</li>
                  <li>The charger must be UL-listed and meet APS specifications</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We file the entire APS rebate application on your behalf, at no extra cost. Most customers receive their rebate check within 4–6 weeks of the approved application.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">What is the Federal Tax Credit for EV charger installation?</button>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>The Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit (IRS Form 8911), established under the Inflation Reduction Act, allows homeowners to claim 30% of the cost of EV charging equipment and its installation. The maximum credit is $1,000 per year for residential filers. This credit applies at your primary or secondary residence. We provide itemized receipts and documentation to support your tax claim. Consult a tax professional to confirm your specific eligibility.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">Can I combine the APS rebate and the Federal Tax Credit?</button>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Yes. The APS $250 rebate and the 30% Federal Tax Credit can be combined. Note that the Federal Tax Credit is calculated on the net cost after any rebates and grants, so your tax credit base may be reduced by the rebate amount. Even so, most homeowners save $400–$1,200 combined through both programs. <a href="services/ev-charger-rebates-incentives-gilbert.html">Learn more about all available incentives.</a></p>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">Do I need a permit to install an EV charger in Gilbert, AZ?</button>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Yes. The Town of Gilbert requires an electrical permit for EV charger installations that involve new circuits, wiring modifications, or breaker panel changes. This is standard practice across Arizona municipalities. Installing a charger without a permit is against local code and can create serious problems — including insurance issues and complications when selling your home. Gilbert EV Charge handles all permitting on your behalf, including application, inspection scheduling, and final sign-off. This service is included in every installation at no extra cost.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">How long does installation take?</button>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Most residential Level 2 charger installations take 2 to 4 hours from start to finish. This includes running a dedicated 240V circuit from your electrical panel, installing conduit as needed, mounting the EVSE unit, and testing the complete system. If your panel needs an upgrade or the wiring run is particularly long — such as to a detached garage — it may take 4 to 6 hours. Commercial multi-unit installations typically require 1 to 2 full days.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">Does my electrical panel need to be upgraded?</button>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Most modern homes in Gilbert (built after 2000) have 200A electrical panels, which are typically sufficient for a Level 2 EV charger installation without an upgrade. Older homes with 100A panels may need an upgrade, especially if you also run large appliances like pool equipment, AC, or electric dryers. We assess your panel capacity as part of every free quote and advise you honestly — we only recommend an upgrade when it is genuinely necessary.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">Can you install a charger in a detached garage or carport?</button>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Yes. We install EV chargers in attached garages, detached garages, carports, driveways, and outdoor parking areas. Running wiring to a detached garage or outbuilding typically involves underground conduit, which adds to cost and time. We will assess the best route during your free quote and provide a fully itemized estimate.</p>

              <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">What is the difference between Level 1, Level 2, and DC Fast Charging?</button>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>There are three main levels of EV charging:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Level 1 (120V):</strong> Uses a standard household outlet. Delivers 3–5 miles of range per hour. Good for plug-in hybrids or emergency charging, but too slow for most full EV owners.</li>
                  <li><strong>Level 2 (240V):</strong> Requires a dedicated 240V circuit, the same voltage as a dryer or range. Delivers 15–35 miles of range per hour. This is the gold standard for home and workplace charging.</li>
                  <li><strong>DC Fast Charging (Level 3):</strong> Commercial-grade chargers found at public charging stations. Delivers 100–350 miles of range per hour. Not practical for residential installation due to very high cost and power requirements.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We specialize in Level 2 residential and commercial installations.</p>

              <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">Can you install a Tesla Wall Connector?</button>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Absolutely. Tesla Wall Connector Gen 3 installation is one of our most popular services. The Gen 3 unit delivers up to 48A and can add up to 44 miles of range per hour for compatible Tesla vehicles. We handle the dedicated circuit, wall mounting, and device configuration. The Gen 3 Wall Connector is also compatible with non-Tesla EVs via a J1772 adapter.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>We install all major EVSE brands including:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>ChargePoint Home Flex (16–50A, WiFi-enabled)</li>
                  <li>JuiceBox 40 and JuiceBox 48</li>

                </ul>
                <p>We are also happy to install customer-supplied chargers, provided they are UL-listed and meet NEC Article 625 requirements. Ask us for a recommendation based on your vehicle and usage — we have no brand affiliation and will give you an honest opinion.</p>
