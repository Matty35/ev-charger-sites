        <h2>Why Overland Park Employers Are Adding Workplace EV Charging</h2>
        <p>Overland Park is one of the most competitive corporate talent markets in the Kansas City metro. With a concentration of technology, finance, healthcare, and professional services employers — many located in the corporate corridors that grew up around the former Sprint and T-Mobile campuses — attracting and retaining skilled professionals requires competitive benefits packages. Workplace EV charging has moved from a perk to a genuine recruiting differentiator in Johnson County's tight labor market.</p>

        <p>Employee surveys consistently show that EV-driving employees rank workplace charging as one of the most valued benefits — often above free parking or gym memberships. For companies located in Overland Park's major office parks along College Boulevard, Metcalf Avenue, and surrounding corridors, adding EV charging is a straightforward investment with measurable retention and recruitment value.</p>

        <h2>Our Workplace EV Charging Installation Process</h2>

        <h3>Needs Assessment &amp; Employee Survey</h3>
        <p>We begin with a workplace charging needs assessment that considers your current employee EV count, anticipated growth based on regional trends, parking lot layout, and electrical service capacity. We can provide an anonymous employee EV survey template to help you gather data before your planning session.</p>

        <h3>Scalable System Design</h3>
        <p>Workplace charging programs that start with 4 ports often need to expand to 20 or more within 3 years as EV adoption grows among your workforce. We design every installation with future scalability built in — running conduit and sub-panel capacity for double or triple the initial number of chargers, at minimal additional cost when you are ready to expand.</p>

        <h3>Load Management Integration</h3>
        <p>Commercial workplace charging in Overland Park uses Evergy's commercial electric service, which includes demand charges based on peak consumption. Without smart load management, multiple employees simultaneously charging at full speed can spike your demand charges significantly. We integrate intelligent load management systems that distribute available power across all connected chargers in real time, preventing demand spikes while keeping everyone charged during the workday.</p>

        <h3>Employee Access &amp; Billing Systems</h3>
        <p>Depending on your company's policy, we configure workplace chargers for free-to-all-employees access, RFID card access, or fee-based usage with payroll deduction integration. All networked chargers generate detailed usage reports, allowing your HR or facilities team to track usage, allocate costs by department, and demonstrate the program's value.</p>

        <h2>Workplace Charging Incentives for Overland Park Businesses</h2>
        <p>Overland Park employers can access multiple incentive programs to offset workplace charging installation costs:</p>

        <ul class="styled-list">
          <li><strong>Evergy Commercial EV Charging Rebate:</strong> Evergy offers commercial rebates for qualified workplace EV charging installations in its Kansas service territory. We manage the full Evergy rebate application process for every workplace installation.</li>
          <li><strong>Federal 30% Commercial Tax Credit:</strong> The Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit applies to commercial and workplace installations at 30% of qualified costs. This applies to both equipment and installation labor. Consult your tax advisor to confirm eligibility based on your business structure.</li>
          <li><strong>Kansas Workforce Development Incentives:</strong> Some Overland Park and Johnson County employers may be able to frame workplace charging as part of workforce development benefit packages eligible for state incentive programs. Contact us to discuss documentation we can provide to support these applications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Workplace Charger Options We Install</h2>

        <h3>ChargePoint CPF50 — Most Popular for Overland Park Offices</h3>
        <p>The ChargePoint CPF50 is the gold standard for workplace charging in North America. It features a sleek design, dual-port configuration (two vehicles per pedestal), robust ChargePoint network integration, RFID card access, and comprehensive usage reporting. Most Overland Park office buildings use ChargePoint for its network reliability and brand recognition among EV drivers.</p>

        <h3>Enel X JuiceBox Pro</h3>
        <p>The JuiceBox Pro offers excellent value for mid-size Overland Park employers. 48A per port, smart load management, OCPP compliance, and strong network software make it a competitive alternative to ChargePoint at a lower per-port cost. Well-suited for companies installing 6 to 20 ports in their first phase.</p>

        <h3>Blink IQ 200</h3>
        <p>For employers who want to leverage the Blink public network (allowing public access during off-hours or weekends), the Blink IQ 200 provides dual-port Level 2 charging with full network management and revenue generation options.</p>

        <h2>Fleet EV Charging</h2>
        <p>Overland Park companies transitioning their vehicle fleets to EVs require depot charging solutions at their facilities. We design and install fleet EV charging systems that integrate with fleet management software, allow overnight charging of all fleet vehicles, and manage energy costs through smart scheduling around Evergy's time-of-use rates. We handle fleet charging projects from 2 vehicles to 50+ vehicles.</p>

        <h2>Employer Benefits of Workplace EV Charging</h2>
        <ul class="styled-list">
          <li>Demonstrated commitment to sustainability goals and ESG reporting metrics</li>
          <li>Improved employee satisfaction scores and benefits competitiveness</li>
          <li>Reduced employee range anxiety — employees arrive knowing they will charge at work</li>
