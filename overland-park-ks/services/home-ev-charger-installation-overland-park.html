        <h2>Why Overland Park Homeowners Are Installing Level 2 EV Chargers</h2>
        <p>Overland Park has become one of the highest EV adoption markets in the Kansas City metro. Driven by Johnson County's affluent, tech-savvy population and proximity to major employers including companies in the former Sprint and T-Mobile corridors, electric vehicle ownership has grown rapidly across neighborhoods from Deer Creek to the Blue Valley area. Yet many of these EV owners are still relying on standard 120V outlet charging — costing them hours of charge time and range anxiety every morning.</p>

        <p>A Level 2 home EV charger, installed by a licensed Overland Park electrician, changes that completely. Instead of plugging into a household outlet and gaining 4 to 7 miles of range per hour, a Level 2 charger delivers 20 to 35+ miles of range per hour, meaning your Hyundai IONIQ 5, Tesla Model X, or Kia EV6 is fully charged overnight — every single morning, without fail.</p>

        <h2>What's Included in Our Home EV Charger Installation Service</h2>
        <p>When you choose Overland Park EV Charge for your residential EV charger installation, you receive a complete, end-to-end service. This is not a "drop the charger and leave" operation. Here is exactly what we do:</p>

        <ul class="styled-list">
          <li><strong>Free site assessment:</strong> We evaluate your electrical panel, available circuit capacity, garage layout, and optimal charger mounting location before providing your quote.</li>
          <li><strong>Charger recommendation:</strong> Based on your EV, daily mileage, and budget, we recommend the right Level 2 charger model and amperage for your specific situation.</li>
          <li><strong>Permit application:</strong> We pull the required City of Overland Park electrical permit before any work begins. No permit, no work — we follow the rules because your safety and insurance depend on it.</li>
          <li><strong>Professional installation:</strong> A licensed Kansas electrician installs your charger, runs conduit as needed, and connects to a dedicated 240V circuit. We work cleanly and restore any disturbed areas.</li>
          <li><strong>City inspection:</strong> We schedule and attend the required inspection with a City of Overland Park electrical inspector. We give you a copy of the passed inspection report.</li>
          <li><strong>Evergy rebate filing:</strong> We prepare and submit your Evergy home EV charger rebate application, including all required documentation. You do not touch a single form.</li>
          <li><strong>App setup &amp; walkthrough:</strong> We walk you through the charger's mobile app, scheduling features, and energy monitoring before we leave. Your first charge happens the same day.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Level 2 Charger Options for Overland Park Homes</h2>
        <p>We install all major Level 2 EV charger brands and stock them locally for fast turnaround. The most popular choices among Overland Park homeowners include:</p>

        <h3>ChargePoint Home Flex</h3>
        <p>The ChargePoint Home Flex is one of the most popular smart home EV chargers in the Kansas City market. It offers adjustable amperage from 16A to 50A, a dedicated mobile app with scheduling and energy tracking, and is ENERGY STAR certified — meaning it qualifies for both the Evergy rebate and the Federal 30% Tax Credit. The ChargePoint app integrates with Evergy's smart charging programs for potential off-peak savings.</p>

        <h3>JuiceBox 48</h3>
        <p>The Enel X JuiceBox 48 delivers a full 48 amps (11.5 kW) for the fastest Level 2 home charging available. It features Wi-Fi connectivity, Amazon Alexa integration, and a robust scheduling interface. JuiceBox units are ENERGY STAR certified and compatible with Evergy's smart charging incentives.</p>

        <h3>Emporia EV Charger</h3>
        <p>The Emporia is the best value option for budget-conscious Overland Park homeowners who still want smart features. At a lower price point than ChargePoint or JuiceBox, it offers 48A output, a solid companion app, and full Evergy rebate and federal credit eligibility.</p>

        <h3>Wallbox Pulsar Plus</h3>
        <p>The Wallbox Pulsar Plus is a compact, stylish 48A smart charger popular in Overland Park's upscale neighborhoods near Leawood and Deer Creek. It features Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, dynamic power sharing for multi-EV homes, and a sleek design that works well in finished garages.</p>

        <h2>Panel Requirements &amp; Upgrades</h2>
        <p>A 48-amp Level 2 charger requires a 60-amp dedicated circuit and a 200-amp (or larger) main electrical panel. Many homes in established Overland Park neighborhoods — particularly those built before 1990 — may have 100-amp or 150-amp panels. During our free site assessment, we check your panel's current load and available capacity.</p>

        <p>If your panel needs an upgrade, we provide transparent pricing and can often perform the panel upgrade and charger installation on the same visit. Alternatively, if a full upgrade is not immediately feasible, we can install a smart charger with load management capability — allowing the charger to automatically reduce its draw when high-consumption appliances are running, avoiding the need for a panel upgrade entirely.</p>

        <h2>Evergy Rebate &amp; Federal Tax Credit</h2>
        <p>Overland Park homeowners who are Evergy electric customers may qualify for Evergy's home EV charger rebate, which covers a portion of the purchase and installation cost of a qualified Level 2 charger. This rebate can be stacked with the Federal Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Tax Credit — 30% of the combined equipment and installation cost, up to $1,000 for residential installations.</p>

        <p>We manage the entire Evergy rebate application process as part of every residential installation. When our installer leaves your home, your rebate application is already filed. You will receive the rebate check from Evergy in the weeks following installation, which you can apply toward your invoice or keep as savings.</p>

        <h2>Common Installation Scenarios in Overland Park</h2>

        <h3>Standard Attached Garage (Most Common)</h3>
        <p>Most Overland Park homes in areas like Deer Creek and the Blue Valley corridor have attached garages with the electrical panel in the garage or an interior utility room nearby. This is the simplest and least expensive installation scenario — typically completed in 2 to 3 hours with a 25-foot or shorter conduit run. Cost: $800–$1,300 before incentives.</p>

        <h3>Detached Garage or Exterior Installation</h3>
        <p>Homes with detached garages or driveway installations require a longer conduit run — sometimes underground — from the main panel to the charger location. These installations take 4 to 6 hours and require additional materials but are very common in Overland Park's larger lot neighborhoods. Cost: $1,200–$2,000 before incentives.</p>

        <h3>Panel Upgrade Required</h3>
        <p>If your panel needs upgrading to accommodate the EV charger circuit, we handle the upgrade as part of the same project. A 200-amp panel upgrade adds $1,500–$2,500 to the project cost but may also provide headroom for other future electrical improvements. After incentives, many Overland Park homeowners still come out ahead of continuing to struggle with Level 1 charging.</p>

        <h2>Why Not Just Use Public Chargers in Overland Park?</h2>
        <p>Public charging stations in the Kansas City metro — while more plentiful than they were three years ago — are not a substitute for home charging. They can be occupied during peak hours near busy areas and employers. The per-kWh cost at public fast chargers is significantly higher than Evergy's residential rate, and you lose control over your charging schedule. With a home Level 2 charger, you plug in every evening when you arrive home and wake up to a full battery — no planning, no waiting, no per-session fees.</p>
