          <h2>Workplace Charging Is Now a Recruiting and Retention Tool</h2>
          <p>Gilbert, Arizona's business community is thriving. The proximity to Intel's Chandler campus, the growing TSMC semiconductor facility nearby, and the hundreds of tech, healthcare, and professional services firms that call the East Valley home means Gilbert employers are competing for top talent. Electric vehicle adoption among high-earning knowledge workers is accelerating — and workplace EV charging has become a meaningful differentiator in recruiting and retention conversations.</p>
          <p>A 2024 survey found that 68% of EV-driving employees consider workplace charging access important when evaluating job offers, and 42% would leave a current employer for a competitor that offered it. For Gilbert businesses, the question is no longer whether to offer workplace charging — it's how to implement it efficiently and cost-effectively.</p>
          <p>Gilbert EV Charge makes that straightforward. We design, permit, install, and commission employee EV charging systems that scale with your organization's needs and budget.</p>

          <h2>Workplace Charging Solutions We Offer</h2>
          <ul class="content-list">
            <li><strong>Basic Employee Charging (Non-Networked)</strong> — Simple Level 2 EVSE units in designated employee parking spaces. Ideal for small employers with 10–30 EV-driving employees. Low initial cost, no monthly network fees.</li>
            <li><strong>Smart Networked Workplace Charging</strong> — WiFi-enabled, app-managed Level 2 stations that let you control access, set employee-facing pricing (free, subsidized, or cost-recovery), and monitor usage and energy costs from a web dashboard.</li>
            <li><strong>Load-Managed Multi-Station Systems</strong> — For larger installations where you have many chargers sharing a limited electrical capacity, we implement load management systems (via ChargePoint, Enel X, or Siemens) that intelligently allocate power across stations to avoid demand charges while maximizing charging throughput.</li>
            <li><strong>RFID and App-Access Systems</strong> — Restrict charger access to authorized employees using RFID cards or app-based authentication, ensuring your investment benefits your team.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalable Infrastructure (Make-Ready)</strong> — We install the underground conduit, wiring, and sub-panel infrastructure to support future charger expansion, so you can add stations as your EV-driving workforce grows without tearing up your parking lot again.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The Business Case for Workplace Charging in Gilbert</h2>
          <p>Beyond the employee benefit angle, workplace EV charging delivers several concrete business benefits:</p>
          <ul class="content-list">
            <li><strong>Federal Tax Credit</strong> — Businesses can claim a 30% Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit on equipment and installation costs, up to $100,000 per location under the IRA. This dramatically reduces net investment.</li>
            <li><strong>APS Commercial Incentives</strong> — Arizona Public Service offers rebates and demand rate programs for commercial EV charging installations. We identify and apply for all applicable programs.</li>
            <li><strong>Revenue Generation</strong> — Networked systems allow you to charge employees for electricity at cost or at a premium, potentially recovering your infrastructure investment over time.</li>
            <li><strong>LEED and ESG Reporting</strong> — EV charging infrastructure contributes to LEED certification points and supports corporate sustainability reporting and ESG goals.</li>
            <li><strong>Property Value</strong> — Commercial properties with EV charging infrastructure command higher lease rates and attract tenants in the professional and tech sectors.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Serving Gilbert's Employer Community</h2>
          <p>We have completed workplace charging installations for a range of Gilbert and East Valley businesses, from professional services offices along Williams Field Road to light industrial facilities near the Santan Freeway. We understand the specific electrical infrastructure common in Gilbert's commercial building stock and work efficiently within existing utility constraints.</p>
          <p>If your business is near the Intel or TSMC supplier network, we can scale to handle larger installations required by high-tech manufacturing support facilities. We are equally experienced with the boutique office parks and medical complexes that make up much of Gilbert's commercial fabric.</p>

          <h2>Our Workplace Installation Process</h2>
          <ol class="content-list">
            <li><strong>Discovery Call</strong> — We learn about your organization's size, parking setup, and goals for the charging program.</li>
            <li><strong>Site Survey</strong> — We assess your electrical service capacity, parking layout, and optimal charger placement.</li>
            <li><strong>Proposal</strong> — You receive a detailed proposal with equipment recommendations, system design, cost breakdown, and applicable incentives.</li>
            <li><strong>Permit &amp; Installation</strong> — We manage all permitting and complete the installation with minimal disruption to your operations.</li>
            <li><strong>Training &amp; Handoff</strong> — We configure your network portal, train your facilities team, and provide documentation for your tax credit filing.</li>
          </ol>
