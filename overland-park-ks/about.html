        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>Overland Park EV Charge is a locally owned and operated electrical contracting company specializing exclusively in EV charging infrastructure for residential and commercial customers across Johnson County, Kansas. We are based in Overland Park and serve the entire Kansas City metro, including Olathe, Lenexa, Shawnee, Leawood, and Prairie Village.</p>

        <p>Unlike general electrical contractors who treat EV charger installs as an afterthought, our entire business is built around the EV charging experience. We know every Evergy rebate program, every city permit requirement, and every charger brand on the market — because it is all we do.</p>

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Our founding team saw firsthand how rapidly the Kansas City metro was transitioning to electric vehicles — driven by strong growth in the tech and corporate sector around the former Sprint and T-Mobile campuses in Overland Park, and by the affluent, environmentally conscious families throughout Johnson County's Deer Creek, Blue Valley, and Leawood border communities. Yet the installation experience was inconsistent: contractors who didn't understand EV charger requirements, missed rebate opportunities, and delayed permits.</p>

        <p>We launched Overland Park EV Charge to fix that. Our mission is simple: make home and commercial EV charging installation in Overland Park and Johnson County as seamless as possible, while ensuring every customer captures every available dollar in Evergy rebates and federal tax credits.</p>

        <h2>Our Team</h2>
        <p>Every member of our installation team is a licensed Kansas Master or Journeyman Electrician with specific training in EV charging system design, panel assessment, and load management. We carry full general liability insurance and workers' compensation coverage on every job. We do not use unlicensed subcontractors.</p>

        <p>Our office team includes a dedicated rebate coordinator who manages every Evergy rebate application and Federal 30% Tax Credit documentation package. We have processed dozens of Evergy EV charger rebates for Overland Park homeowners and know exactly what the program requires to avoid delays or rejections.</p>

        <h2>Why Choose a Local Company?</h2>
        <p>National EV charger installation networks often dispatch technicians from out of state or from distant parts of the Kansas City metro, resulting in long wait times, unfamiliarity with local permit processes, and no accountability after the installation is complete. When you call Overland Park EV Charge, you reach a local team member who knows the Johnson County permit office, knows Evergy's rebate timeline, and can be back at your home if any issue ever arises.</p>

        <p>We are your neighbors. Our team lives and drives EVs in the same communities we serve — from Deer Creek to Blue Valley, from the Leawood border to the heart of Overland Park. That local commitment means faster scheduling, better communication, and a better overall experience.</p>

        <h2>Our Community</h2>
        <p>Overland Park is one of the fastest-growing cities in the Kansas City metro and consistently ranks among the best places to live in the Midwest. The combination of Johnson County's strong school systems — including the highly regarded Blue Valley school district — top employers, and high quality of life has attracted a disproportionately high rate of EV adoption compared to surrounding regions.</p>

        <p>We are proud to support that growth by making home EV charging accessible, affordable, and hassle-free for every Overland Park family and business. As the Kansas City metro continues to expand and EV adoption accelerates, we are committed to being the most trusted name in EV charger installation throughout Johnson County.</p>
