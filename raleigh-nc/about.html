          <h2>Who We Are</h2>
          <p>Raleigh EV Charge is a locally owned and operated electrical contracting company specializing exclusively in EV charger installation. We were founded right here in Raleigh, NC with a simple mission: make the transition to electric vehicle ownership as easy and affordable as possible for Triangle-area residents and businesses.</p>
          <p>Our founders recognized that while EV adoption in North Carolina was accelerating rapidly — driven by the area's tech-forward culture, the concentration of employers at Research Triangle Park, the presence of NC State University and UNC, and the increasing availability of affordable EVs — many homeowners and businesses were struggling to navigate the installation process. Permit requirements, utility rebate applications, electrical panel assessments, and charger selection felt overwhelming. We built Raleigh EV Charge to remove every one of those obstacles.</p>
          <p>Today, we've completed over 156 installations across Raleigh, Cary, Durham, Chapel Hill, Apex, Wake Forest, Garner, and Morrisville. Our team includes EVSE-certified electricians, North Carolina Licensed Electrical Contractors, and customer service specialists who genuinely love electric vehicles and sustainable transportation.</p>

          <h2>Our Certifications &amp; Credentials</h2>
          <p>Every member of our installation team holds the credentials required to perform safe, code-compliant EV charger installations in North Carolina:</p>
          <ul class="content-list">
            <li><strong>EVSE Installation Certification</strong> — Specialized training in Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment installation, covering NEC Article 625, load calculations, and charger commissioning.</li>
            <li><strong>North Carolina Licensed Electrical Contractor</strong> — We hold an active license through the NC State Board of Examiners of Electrical Contractors, required for all permitted electrical work in the state.</li>
            <li><strong>Fully Licensed &amp; Insured</strong> — General liability insurance and workers' compensation coverage protect you and our team on every job site.</li>
            <li><strong>Duke Energy Progress Experienced</strong> — We are familiar with Duke Energy Progress utility requirements and are experienced in filing the $200 Duke Energy Progress EV charger rebate on behalf of our customers.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Our Commitment to Raleigh</h2>
          <p>Raleigh is one of the fastest-growing cities in the United States, and the Research Triangle's EV adoption rate reflects that forward-looking attitude. From the established neighborhoods of North Hills and Glenwood South to the growing corridors of Brier Creek, North Hills, and the communities surrounding Research Triangle Park, our city is embracing clean transportation in a big way.</p>
          <p>We are proud to be part of that transition. Every installation we complete reduces fossil fuel dependence, lowers household transportation costs, and contributes to cleaner air across Wake County. We take that responsibility seriously, which is why we never cut corners on quality, permitting, or safety.</p>
          <p>When you hire Raleigh EV Charge, you're not just getting an electrician — you're getting a team that genuinely cares about making EV ownership work for you, your home, and your community.</p>

          <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
          <p>There are general electricians who will install an EV charger, and then there are specialists who live and breathe EVSE. We are the latter. Because EV charger installation is our core business — not a side service — we stay current on every new charger model, changing utility rebate programs, evolving NEC code updates, and best practices for residential and commercial EVSE systems.</p>
          <p>We also believe in transparent pricing. When we give you a quote, it includes the permit fee, inspection scheduling, and rebate application assistance. There are no surprise line items after the job is done.</p>
