      <h2>Costs &amp; Pricing</h2>
      <div class="faq-item open">
        <button class="faq-q">How much does EV charger installation cost in Frisco, TX? <span class="faq-toggle">+</span></button>
        <div class="faq-a">Most Frisco homeowners pay between $750 and $1,800 for a complete Level 2 EV charger installation. This range covers the charger hardware, all wiring and conduit, panel circuit addition, mounting hardware, and labor. More complex jobs — such as running wire through a finished wall, installing in a detached garage, or upgrading a 100-amp panel — can cost more. We provide itemized, flat-rate quotes before any work begins.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-q">Does a Tesla Wall Connector cost more to install than other chargers? <span class="faq-toggle">+</span></button>
        <div class="faq-a">The Tesla Wall Connector hardware itself retails for around $400–$500. Installation labor is similar to other Level 2 chargers. The main cost driver is whether a dedicated 60-amp circuit already exists in your panel and how far the charger is from your electrical panel. We install Tesla Wall Connectors regularly across Frisco and can give you a precise quote over the phone for most standard garage setups.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-q">What if my panel needs an upgrade — how much extra is that? <span class="faq-toggle">+</span></button>
        <div class="faq-a">Adding a dedicated 40–60 amp circuit to an existing 200-amp panel with available space typically adds $200–$500 to the job. If your panel is already at capacity or is an older 100-amp service, a full panel upgrade to 200 amps can add $1,500–$3,500 depending on your home's layout and the local Oncor service requirements. We assess your panel during the free consultation so you always know the full cost before we start.</div>

      <h2>Rebates &amp; Incentives</h2>
      <div class="faq-item open">
        <button class="faq-q">What is the Federal 30% Tax Credit for EV charger installation? <span class="faq-toggle">+</span></button>
        <div class="faq-a">Under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), homeowners can claim a 30% federal tax credit on the combined cost of EV charging equipment and installation labor, up to a maximum credit of $1,000 for residential installations. This credit directly reduces the federal income tax you owe — it is a true credit, not a deduction. Since Texas has no state income tax, this federal credit is the primary government incentive available to Frisco residents. We document your installation costs so your accountant has everything needed to claim the credit.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-q">Does Oncor Electric Delivery offer rebates for EV charger installation in Frisco? <span class="faq-toggle">+</span></button>
        <div class="faq-a">Yes. Oncor Electric Delivery serves the Frisco area and has offered rebate programs for qualifying residential EV charging equipment. Rebate amounts and program availability can change on a quarterly basis. We track Oncor's current programs and apply for every rebate you qualify for as part of our standard service. Oncor rebates and the Federal 30% Tax Credit can be stacked, meaning you could potentially combine both incentives on the same installation.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-q">Is there a Texas state EV charger tax credit? <span class="faq-toggle">+</span></button>
        <div class="faq-a">No. Texas does not have a state income tax, which means there is no state-level EV charger tax credit. The good news is that the absence of state income tax means Frisco residents take home more of their paycheck, making the out-of-pocket cost of EV charging equipment more affordable. The Federal 30% Tax Credit is available to all eligible Texas homeowners regardless of the lack of a state credit.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-q">Can I charge at off-peak rates with Oncor to save money? <span class="faq-toggle">+</span></button>
        <div class="faq-a">Oncor's retail electricity providers offer time-of-use (TOU) rate plans where electricity is cheaper during off-peak hours, typically late at night and early morning. We can install and configure smart EV chargers — including the ChargePoint Home Flex, JuiceBox, and Emporia — that automatically schedule charging during these lower-cost windows. This can meaningfully reduce your monthly electricity bill, especially for EV owners who drive significant daily mileage.</div>
      </div>

    <div class="faq-category">
      <h2>Permits &amp; Installation Process</h2>
      <div class="faq-item open">
        <button class="faq-q">Do I need a permit for EV charger installation in Frisco, TX? <span class="faq-toggle">+</span></button>
        <div class="faq-a">Yes. The City of Frisco requires an electrical permit for any Level 2 (240V) EV charger installation. This is non-negotiable for both legal and insurance reasons — an unpermitted installation could void your homeowner's insurance or cause problems when selling your home. As licensed electricians, we handle 100% of the permitting process: application, fee payment, scheduling the City of Frisco inspection, and obtaining the final approval certificate. Permit fees are included in our quotes.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-q">How long does installation take in Frisco? <span class="faq-toggle">+</span></button>
        <div class="faq-a">Most standard Level 2 home charger installations in Frisco take 2 to 4 hours. Factors that extend installation time include: running wire through finished walls or ceilings, installation in a detached garage requiring exterior conduit, panel upgrades, and multi-charger setups in 3-car garages (common in Starwood and Frisco Lakes neighborhoods). We will give you an accurate time estimate during the free consultation based on your specific home layout.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-q">How soon can you schedule installation in Frisco? <span class="faq-toggle">+</span></button>
        <div class="faq-a">We typically have availability within 3–7 business days for Frisco and nearby communities. In many cases, we can offer next-week slots or even same-week availability depending on our schedule. Call us at (972) 555-0202 for our current availability — we prioritize Frisco-area customers since it is our home market.</div>

      <h2>Frisco-Specific Questions</h2>
      <div class="faq-item open">
        <button class="faq-q">Why is EV adoption growing so fast in Frisco? <span class="faq-toggle">+</span></button>
        <div class="faq-a">Frisco is one of the fastest-growing and most affluent cities in America. The arrival of Toyota North America, Liberty Mutual, and numerous tech and finance companies has brought thousands of high-income professionals to the area — demographics that skew heavily toward EV adoption. The PGA of America's headquarters and FC Dallas stadium have added to the area's profile as a premier destination. Additionally, Frisco's newer housing stock features modern electrical panels and spacious garages, making EV charger installation easier and less expensive than in older DFW neighborhoods.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-q">Do you serve neighborhoods like Starwood, Stonebriar, and Frisco Lakes? <span class="faq-toggle">+</span></button>
        <div class="faq-a">Yes — these are among our most active service areas. Starwood and Stonebriar are master-planned communities with large homes, 3-car garages, and homeowners who are frequent EV purchasers. Frisco Lakes is our most popular community for retirement-age EV drivers upgrading from luxury sedans to vehicles like the Cadillac Lyriq or BMW iX. We know the typical electrical setups in each of these neighborhoods and can often quote you accurately over the phone.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-q">I work at Toyota or Liberty Mutual in Frisco — can you install at my home? <span class="faq-toggle">+</span></button>
        <div class="faq-a">Absolutely. Many of our residential customers are employees at Toyota North America's Plano/Frisco campus, Liberty Mutual's Plano campus, and other major corporate facilities in the area. If you've received an EV as a company vehicle or benefit, or if you're simply taking advantage of employee EV purchase programs offered by these companies, we make home charging fast and hassle-free. Call us at (972) 555-0202 and we'll get you scheduled quickly.</div>
