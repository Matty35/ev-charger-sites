          <h2>Who We Are</h2>
          <p>Bellevue EV Charge is a locally owned and operated electrical contracting company specializing exclusively in EV charger installation. We were founded right here in Bellevue, WA with a simple mission: make the transition to electric vehicle ownership as easy and affordable as possible for Eastside residents and businesses.</p>
          <p>Our founders recognized that while EV adoption across the Greater Eastside was accelerating rapidly — driven by the area's concentration of tech employers like Microsoft in Redmond, Amazon's growing Eastside presence, and the increasing availability of affordable EVs — many homeowners and businesses were struggling to navigate the installation process. Permit requirements, utility rebate applications, electrical panel assessments, and charger selection felt overwhelming. We built Bellevue EV Charge to remove every one of those obstacles.</p>
          <p>Today, we've completed over 147 installations across Bellevue, Seattle, Redmond, Kirkland, Issaquah, Mercer Island, Sammamish, and Renton. Our team includes EVSE-certified electricians, Washington State L&amp;I-licensed contractors, and customer service specialists who genuinely love electric vehicles and sustainable transportation.</p>
          <p>In the Pacific Northwest, where rainy winters and grey skies are a fact of life, having a Level 2 home charger means you never have to stand at a cold, wet public charging station for routine top-ups. You plug in at home, and every morning your EV is fully charged and ready — whether you're heading to the Microsoft campus, the Amazon office in Bellevue's Overlake area, or crossing the SR-520 bridge into Seattle.</p>

          <h2>Our Certifications &amp; Credentials</h2>
          <p>Every member of our installation team holds the credentials required to perform safe, code-compliant EV charger installations in Washington State:</p>
          <ul class="content-list">
            <li><strong>EVSE Installation Certification</strong> — Specialized training in Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment installation, covering NEC Article 625, load calculations, and charger commissioning.</li>
            <li><strong>Washington State Licensed Electrical Contractor (L&amp;I)</strong> — We hold an active Washington State Department of Labor &amp; Industries (L&amp;I) electrical contractor license, required for all permitted electrical work in the state.</li>
            <li><strong>Fully Licensed &amp; Insured</strong> — General liability insurance and workers' compensation coverage protect you and our team on every job site.</li>
            <li><strong>PSE Familiar Contractor</strong> — We are familiar with Puget Sound Energy (PSE) utility requirements and are experienced in filing the $200 PSE EV charger rebate on behalf of our customers.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Our Commitment to Bellevue</h2>
          <p>Bellevue is one of the most dynamic cities in the Pacific Northwest — a global tech hub set against the backdrop of Lake Washington and the Cascade foothills. From the upscale shopping of The Bravern to the family neighborhoods of Somerset, Newport Hills, and Lakemont, and the corporate towers of Downtown Bellevue's skyline, our community reflects the forward-looking spirit that makes Washington State a leader in EV adoption.</p>
          <p>Washington State consistently ranks among the top states for electric vehicle ownership, and Bellevue residents are at the forefront of that movement. We are proud to be part of that transition. Every installation we complete reduces fossil fuel dependence, lowers household transportation costs, and contributes to cleaner air across King County.</p>
          <p>We take that responsibility seriously, which is why we never cut corners on quality, permitting, or safety. When you hire Bellevue EV Charge, you're not just getting an electrician — you're getting a team that genuinely cares about making EV ownership work for you, your home, and your community.</p>

          <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
          <p>There are general electricians who will install an EV charger, and then there are specialists who live and breathe EVSE. We are the latter. Because EV charger installation is our core business — not a side service — we stay current on every new charger model, changing utility rebate programs, evolving NEC code updates, and best practices for residential and commercial EVSE systems.</p>
          <p>We also believe in transparent pricing. When we give you a quote, it includes the permit fee, inspection scheduling, and rebate application assistance. There are no surprise line items after the job is done. We work with City of Bellevue Development Services regularly and know exactly what inspectors look for — which is why our installations pass on the first visit, every time.</p>
