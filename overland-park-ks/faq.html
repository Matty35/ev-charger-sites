        <div class="faq-list">
          <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">What is the Evergy EV charger rebate and how do I qualify in Overland Park?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Evergy offers a rebate to residential customers in its Kansas service territory — which includes Overland Park and all of Johnson County — who purchase and install a qualified Level 2 EV charger at their primary residence. To qualify, you must be an active Evergy customer, install an ENERGY STAR certified Level 2 charger, and submit the required documentation including proof of purchase, installation invoice, and device model information within the program deadline.</p>
              <p>Overland Park EV Charge manages this entire process for you at no additional cost. We ensure the charger we install is on Evergy's qualified product list and submit all paperwork on your behalf. <a href="services/ev-charger-rebates-incentives-overland-park.html">Learn more about Evergy rebates.</a></p>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">How does the Federal 30% EV Charger Tax Credit work?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>The Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit (IRS Form 8911) allows homeowners to claim 30% of the cost of qualified EV charger equipment and installation labor, up to $1,000 for residential installations. This is a tax credit — not a deduction — meaning it directly reduces your federal tax liability dollar for dollar.</p>
              <p>To claim the credit, your charger must be installed at your primary or secondary residence and placed in service during the tax year you are claiming. We provide a detailed, itemized invoice showing equipment cost and labor cost separately, which is the documentation your tax preparer or CPA will need to file Form 8911. Consult your tax advisor to confirm your specific eligibility.</p>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">Can I stack the Evergy rebate with the Federal Tax Credit?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes. The Evergy rebate and the Federal 30% Tax Credit can be combined, making home EV charger installation in Overland Park significantly more affordable than most homeowners expect. For example, on a $1,500 total installation (equipment + labor), you might receive $250 from Evergy's rebate and claim up to $375 in federal tax credits, bringing your effective out-of-pocket cost below $900. We walk every customer through this calculation during the quoting process.</p>

        <h2>Installation &amp; Permits</h2>

        <div class="faq-list">
          <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">Does Overland Park require a permit for EV charger installation?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes. The City of Overland Park requires an electrical permit for any 240V Level 2 EV charger installation. After installation, a city electrical inspector must sign off on the work. This protects homeowners by ensuring the work meets the National Electrical Code and local amendments. Overland Park EV Charge handles all permit applications and schedules the required inspection — you do not need to do anything.</p>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">How long does a typical installation take in Overland Park?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Most residential installations in Overland Park are completed in 2 to 4 hours. This assumes a standard attached garage with accessible panel location and adequate existing capacity. If conduit must be run through walls or outdoors, or if a panel upgrade is required, the job may take 6 to 8 hours or extend to two visits. We give you a realistic timeline estimate during your free site assessment so there are no surprises.</p>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">My home in the Deer Creek neighborhood has an older 100-amp panel. Can I still get a Level 2 charger?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes, in most cases. A 100-amp panel can often accommodate a 30A or 40A Level 2 charger circuit if there is adequate spare capacity. For a 48A circuit (the maximum for most home Level 2 chargers), a 200-amp panel is typically required. Options include a full panel upgrade (usually $1,500–$3,000 depending on scope), installation of an intelligent load management device that shares power between the charger and high-draw appliances, or a smart charger with built-in power sharing. We assess your specific panel during the free site visit and recommend the most cost-effective solution for your situation.</p>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">Will my HOA in Overland Park allow an EV charger installation?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Kansas does not currently have a statewide "right to charge" law that overrides HOA restrictions, unlike some other states. However, many HOAs in Johnson County communities are permissive of EV charger installations in private garages, provided the installation follows city electrical codes and does not modify shared property. We recommend reviewing your HOA's CC&amp;Rs and, if needed, submitting an architectural modification request before scheduling installation. Our team can provide documentation about the installation scope to support your HOA application.</p>

        <h2>Charger Types &amp; Brands</h2>

        <div class="faq-list">
          <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">What is the difference between Level 1 and Level 2 EV chargers?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Level 1 chargers plug into a standard 120V household outlet and deliver approximately 1.2 to 1.8 kW of power — adding only 4 to 7 miles of range per hour. Most EVs have a 60+ kWh battery, meaning a full Level 1 charge from empty can take 40 to 80 hours. Level 2 chargers use a 240V circuit (the same as a dryer or range) and deliver 7.2 to 11.5 kW — adding 20 to 35+ miles of range per hour. A full Level 2 charge typically takes 6 to 12 hours, making it practical to charge overnight and wake up with a full battery every morning.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">Which EV charger brands do you recommend for Overland Park homeowners?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>We are brand-agnostic and recommend based on your EV, usage habits, and budget. For most Overland Park homeowners, we commonly install ChargePoint Home Flex (48A, excellent app), JuiceBox 48 (smart scheduling, Evergy-compatible), Emporia EV Charger (budget-friendly, solid app), Wallbox Pulsar Plus (compact, smart), and Tesla Wall Connector for Tesla owners. All of these qualify for the Evergy rebate and the Federal Tax Credit. We stock all major brands and can usually install within 3 to 5 business days of your quote.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">Why not just use public charging stations in the Kansas City metro instead of installing a home charger?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Public DC fast chargers and Level 2 stations in the Overland Park area — near major destinations and employers like the former Sprint and T-Mobile campuses — are convenient for emergencies or road trips but are poor substitutes for daily home charging. Public chargers are frequently occupied, sometimes out of service, and charge at a significantly higher per-kWh rate than your Evergy residential rate. With a home Level 2 charger, you plug in every night and wake up to a full battery every morning — no detours, no waiting, no uncertainty. The convenience and cost savings pay back the installation cost within 2 to 3 years for most Overland Park EV drivers.</p>

        <div class="faq-list">
          <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">What does EV charger installation cost in Overland Park, KS?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>The total installed cost — including equipment and labor — ranges from $800 to $2,500 for most Overland Park residential installations. The main cost drivers are: the charger model selected ($300–$650), the distance from the panel to the install location, whether conduit must be run through walls or outdoors, and whether a panel upgrade is required. After the Evergy rebate and the Federal 30% Tax Credit, many homeowners' effective out-of-pocket cost is in the $600–$1,400 range.

            <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">Do you offer financing for EV charger installation in Overland Park?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes. We work with third-party financing partners to offer flexible payment plans for Overland Park homeowners who prefer to spread the installation cost over time. Many customers find that the monthly payment for financed installation is offset by fuel savings from switching from gasoline to home electricity, especially at Evergy's competitive residential rates.
