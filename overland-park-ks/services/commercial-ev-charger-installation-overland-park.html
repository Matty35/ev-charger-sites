        <h2>Commercial EV Charging Is No Longer Optional in Johnson County</h2>
        <p>The Kansas City metro's shift toward electric vehicles has accelerated dramatically in Johnson County, where Overland Park leads the region in EV registrations. With major corporate employers in the area, a highly educated professional population, and rising EV adoption across all income brackets, commercial properties that lack EV charging are falling behind.</p>

        <p>Retail centers, office parks, hotels, restaurants, and apartment complexes throughout Overland Park are investing in commercial EV charging stations to attract and retain customers, tenants, and employees. Overland Park EV Charge designs and installs commercial charging solutions of every scale — from a two-port charging station for a small office building to a 20-station deployment for a large retail parking facility.</p>

        <h2>Our Commercial EV Charger Installation Process</h2>

        <h3>Site Assessment &amp; Load Study</h3>
        <p>Commercial EV charger projects begin with a thorough site assessment and electrical load study. We evaluate your existing electrical service capacity, transformer capacity, parking layout, and local utility (Evergy) connection requirements. For larger deployments, we coordinate directly with Evergy's commercial service department on service upgrades or new connections if needed.</p>

        <h3>System Design</h3>
        <p>We produce a complete system design including equipment specifications, conduit routing plans, electrical one-line diagrams, and a phased deployment plan if needed. We design with future scalability in mind — installing conduit and panel capacity for future charger additions at minimal additional cost.</p>

        <h3>Permitting &amp; Utility Coordination</h3>
        <p>Commercial installations require permits from the City of Overland Park and, in some cases, approval from Johnson County or coordination with Evergy for utility service modifications. We manage all of this on your behalf, including any required engineering documents or load calculations.</p>

        <h3>Professional Installation</h3>
        <p>Our licensed commercial electricians install all equipment to code, including conduit runs, panel sub-feeds, EV charger mounting, network connectivity, and signage. We minimize disruption to your business operations and schedule work during off-hours when required.</p>

        <h3>Charger Network Setup &amp; Training</h3>
        <p>All commercial Level 2 units we install are networked and OCPP-compatible, meaning you can control access, set pricing, generate usage reports, and integrate with major charging networks including ChargePoint, Blink, and EV Connect. We train your facilities team on network management and provide documentation for your operations team.</p>

        <h2>Commercial Charger Options for Overland Park Businesses</h2>

        <h3>Level 2 Commercial Stations (7.2–11.5 kW)</h3>
        <p>Commercial Level 2 chargers are ideal for destinations where customers or employees spend 2 to 8 hours — restaurants, retail centers, offices, hotels, gyms, and similar properties. Popular models include ChargePoint CPF50, Enel X JuiceBox Pro, and ClipperCreek HCS Series. All units support RFID access control, usage metering, and network management.</p>

        <h3>Dual-Port Charging Stations</h3>
        <p>Dual-port stations allow two vehicles to charge simultaneously from a single pedestal, reducing installation cost per port and maximizing parking space efficiency. This is our most commonly installed commercial configuration for office and retail customers in Overland Park.</p>

        <h3>DC Fast Charging (Level 3)</h3>
        <p>For high-traffic destinations or fleet applications that require rapid charging, we also design and install DC fast charger (DCFC) systems from 25 kW to 150 kW. These require a larger electrical service and Evergy commercial utility coordination but deliver a full charge to most EVs in 20 to 45 minutes. Contact us to discuss DCFC feasibility for your Overland Park location.</p>

        <h2>Commercial EV Charger Incentives for Overland Park Businesses</h2>
        <p>Commercial EV charging installations in Overland Park may qualify for several significant incentive programs:</p>

        <ul class="styled-list">
          <li><strong>Evergy Commercial EV Charging Rebate:</strong> Evergy offers rebates for commercial customers installing qualified EV charging equipment at commercial locations in its Kansas service territory. Rebate amounts vary by project size. We manage the entire application process.</li>
          <li><strong>Federal Commercial Tax Credit (30%):</strong> The Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit applies to commercial installations at 30% of qualified costs with no per-property cap for commercial applications (within IRS limits). Consult your tax advisor for specifics.</li>
          <li><strong>NEVI / Federal Charging Infrastructure Grants:</strong> For high-traffic commercial locations, federal NEVI formula funds and EV charging grants may be available. We can provide documentation and project specifications to support grant applications.</li>
          <li><strong>Evergy Demand Response Programs:</strong> Networked commercial chargers can participate in Evergy's demand response programs, earning credits for adjusting charging load during peak grid periods.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Industries We Serve in Overland Park</h2>
        <ul class="styled-list">
          <li>Retail shopping centers and strip malls</li>
          <li>Office parks and corporate campuses</li>
          <li>Hotels and hospitality properties</li>
          <li>Multi-family apartment and condominium complexes</li>
          <li>Healthcare facilities and medical office buildings</li>
          <li>Restaurants and entertainment venues</li>
          <li>Auto dealerships (EV display and customer charging)</li>
          <li>Educational and institutional facilities</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Business Case for Commercial EV Charging in Johnson County</h2>
        <p>Beyond incentive programs, commercial EV charging generates tangible business value. Retail and restaurant customers who charge while visiting tend to spend more and stay longer — a well-documented effect across the commercial charging industry. Office tenants with EV charging in the parking structure rate their facilities significantly higher and are more likely to renew leases. In Overland Park's competitive Johnson County commercial real estate market, EV charging is becoming a standard amenity alongside high-speed internet and modern HVAC systems.</p>

        <p>For apartment communities in particular — a fast-growing segment as Overland Park's population continues to expand — EV charging is increasingly a deciding factor for prospective residents, especially in the professional demographic that dominates Johnson County's rental market.</p>
