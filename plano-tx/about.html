          <h2>Who We Are</h2>
          <p>Plano EV Charge is a locally owned and operated electrical contracting company specializing exclusively in EV charger installation. We were founded right here in Plano, TX with a simple mission: make the transition to electric vehicle ownership as easy and affordable as possible for North Texas residents and businesses.</p>
          <p>Our founders recognized that while EV adoption in Texas was accelerating rapidly — driven by the corporate presence of employers like Toyota North America at Legacy Drive, the thriving Legacy West and Legacy Town Center business districts, and the increasing availability of affordable EVs — many homeowners and businesses were struggling to navigate the installation process. Permit requirements, electrical panel assessments, charger selection, and Federal Tax Credit paperwork felt overwhelming. We built Plano EV Charge to remove every one of those obstacles.</p>
          <p>Today, we've completed over 132 installations across Plano, Frisco, Allen, McKinney, Richardson, and The Colony. Our team includes Texas Licensed Master Electricians, TDLR-licensed contractors, and customer service specialists who genuinely love electric vehicles and sustainable transportation.</p>

          <h2>Our Certifications &amp; Credentials</h2>
          <p>Every member of our installation team holds the credentials required to perform safe, code-compliant EV charger installations in Texas:</p>
          <ul class="content-list">
            <li><strong>Texas Licensed Master Electrician</strong> — We hold an active Texas Licensed Master Electrician credential issued by the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR), required for all permitted electrical work in the state.</li>
            <li><strong>EVSE Installation Training</strong> — Specialized training in Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment installation, covering NEC Article 625, load calculations, and charger commissioning.</li>
            <li><strong>Fully Licensed &amp; Insured</strong> — General liability insurance and workers' compensation coverage protect you and our team on every job site.</li>
            <li><strong>Federal Tax Credit Documentation</strong> — We are experienced in providing itemized receipts and documentation for the 30% Federal Tax Credit (IRS Form 8911) on behalf of our customers.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Our Commitment to Plano</h2>
          <p>Plano is one of the most dynamic corporate hubs in the United States, and North Texas's EV adoption rate reflects that forward-looking attitude. From the premier shopping and dining of Legacy West and Shops at Legacy to the wide-open neighborhoods near Jack Carter Park and Willow Bend, our community is embracing clean transportation in a big way. Toyota North America's headquarters on Legacy Drive is a symbol of the major corporate investment Plano attracts — and those employees are driving EVs.</p>
          <p>We are proud to be part of that transition. Every installation we complete reduces fossil fuel dependence, lowers household transportation costs, and contributes to cleaner air across North Texas. We take that responsibility seriously, which is why we never cut corners on quality, permitting, or safety.</p>
          <p>When you hire Plano EV Charge, you're not just getting an electrician — you're getting a team that genuinely cares about making EV ownership work for you, your home, and your community.</p>

          <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
          <p>There are general electricians who will install an EV charger, and then there are specialists who live and breathe EVSE. We are the latter. Because EV charger installation is our core business — not a side service — we stay current on every new charger model, evolving NEC code updates, and best practices for residential and commercial EVSE systems.</p>
          <p>We also believe in transparent pricing. When we give you a quote, it includes the permit fee, inspection scheduling, and Federal Tax Credit documentation assistance. There are no surprise line items after the job is done.</p>
          <p>Texas has a deregulated electricity market, which means Oncor handles the wires and infrastructure in Plano while you choose your own Retail Electric Provider. We can advise you on how this may affect smart charger scheduling — for instance, some REPs like TXU Energy and Reliant offer time-of-use or EV-specific rate plans that pair perfectly with a smart Level 2 charger.</p>
